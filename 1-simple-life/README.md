# Project #1 - Blog of Minimalist

​	Blog with minimalistic design and simple life ideas - makes you wonder how much do you really need. Only three active parts - home, about me and recent posts. Text is just a filler, there are no real articles, yet..

​	Page made by duplicating design from [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/grid "Check out the design at Adobe!").

​	Main things I practised while doing this project and notes to myself: 

- Give everything a class, save id for javascript.
- Structurize my CSS a bit better - start from general styles, separate sections with comments.
- Responsive web design and mobile first approach.
- Flexbox
- Playing with opacity of elements can make your design seem more polished.
- Typography - every color, font, size should have a reason
