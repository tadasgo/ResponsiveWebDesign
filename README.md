# Responsive Web Design Bootcamp



​     Amazing course about all the intricacies of CSS and responsiveness in modern web layouts. During this bootcamp I completed 3 different projects to put my knowledge of fundamentals to test.

1. Blog with minimalistic design and simple life ideas - makes you wonder how much do you really need. Only three active parts - home, about me and recent posts. Originally made this using only Flexbox, later remade it with CSS Grid - just to practice.
   - Page design from [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/75d448ea-569a-4b7e-721b-9bbd3b2b97b9-03e5/grid "Simple life design").
   - [Simple life blog](https://keen-spence-139aa8.netlify.app) - deployed on Netlify.
2. A landing page encouraging people to join webinar and master the art of barbeque.
   - Page design from [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3bcaad42-bd8a-415e-6274-08b282cfb769-4dfb/grid "Become a BBQ master design").
   - [Become a BBQ master](https://vigilant-goldberg-33ea1f.netlify.app) - deployed on Netlify.
3. Last project and the most complicated one. Extraordinary digital marketing agency and its responsive site consisting of three pages - index, about and contact.
   - Page design from [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f255d364-6d5e-4aaf-7703-6f8d0a398281-8464/grid "Jake&Elwood design").
   - [Jake&Elwood](https://awesome-torvalds-58d9f1.netlify.app) - deployed on Netlify.



### Things I learned from this course

- Stopped hating CSS, now I kind of like it.
- Deep understanding of CSS and why it doesn't always work the way you think it should !
- Mobile first workflow. Work smart - start from the easy one.
- Flexbox.
- CSS Grid.
- Craft of smooth animations and transitions.
- All around useful stuff - combinators, viewport units, gradients, variables etc.
- Typography is important - every color, font, size should have a reason.
- Opacity is powerful - it can make your design seem more polished.
