# Project #3 - Jake&Elwood

​	One extraordinary digital marketing agency and its responsive site consisting of three pages - index, about and contact.

​	Page made by duplicating design from [Adobe XD](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f255d364-6d5e-4aaf-7703-6f8d0a398281-8464/grid "Check out the design at Adobe!").

​	Stuff I learned during this project:

- CSS grid
- Testing out the power of SCSS
- Putting the skills I learned to practice one more time - repetition is key
